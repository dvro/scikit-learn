class AllKNearestNeighbors(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin, InstanceReductionMixin):
    """All K-Nearest Neighbors.

    Each class is represented by a set of prototypes, with test samples
    classified to the class with the nearest prototype.
    The All KNN removes the instances in the boundaries, maintaining 
    redudant samples. Creating a much more smooth decision region.
    It is similar to the Repeated-Edited Nearest Neighbors, but it has
    a different approach.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, optional (default = 3)
        Number of limit neighbors to use by default for :meth:`k_neighbors` queries.

    Attributes
    ----------
    `prototypes_` : array-like, shape = [indeterminated, n_features]
        Selected prototypes.

    `labels_` : array-like, shape = [indeterminated]
        Labels of the selected prototypes.

    `reduction_` : float, percentual of reduction.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.instance_reduction.allknn import AllKNearestNeighbors
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> X = np.array([[-1, 0], [-0.8, 1], [-0.8, -1], [-0.5, 0] , [0.5, 0], [1, 0], [0.8, 1], [0.8, -1]])
    >>> y = np.array([1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2])
    >>> all_kneigh = AllKNearestNeighbors()
    >>> all_kneigh.fit(X, y)
    AllKNearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5)
    >>> print(all_kneigh.predict([[-0.6, 0.6]]))
    [1]
    >>> print all_kneigh.reduction_
    0.625
