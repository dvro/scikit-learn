class RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbors(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin, InstanceReductionMixin):
    """Repeated Edited Nearest Neighbors.

    Each class is represented by a set of prototypes, with test samples
    classified to the class with the nearest prototype.
    The Repeated Edited Nearest Neighbors  removes the instances in the 
    boundaries, maintaining redudant samples. Creating a much more smooth
    decision region.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, optional (default = 3)
        Number of neighbors to use by default for :meth:`k_neighbors` queries.

    Attributes
    ----------
    `prototypes_` : array-like, shape = [indeterminated, n_features]
        Selected prototypes.

    `labels_` : array-like, shape = [indeterminated]
        Labels of the selected prototypes.

    `reduction_` : float, percentual of reduction.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from sklearn.instance_reduction.renn import RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbors
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> X = np.array([[-1, 0], [-0.8, 1], [-0.8, -1], [-0.5, 0] , [0.5, 0], [1, 0], [0.8, 1], [0.8, -1]])
    >>> y = np.array([1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2])
    >>> repeated_enn = RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbors()
    >>> repeated_enn.fit(X, y)
    RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=3)
    >>> print(repeated_enn.predict([[-0.6, 0.6]]))
    [1]
    >>> print repeated_enn.reduction_
    0.25
